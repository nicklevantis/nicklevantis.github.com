One of the most unusual sequencer and Modular Synthesizer has now hit beta, ready for you to explore. And that does mean “explore”: think navigation through spinning musical objects in this spatial modular sound environment.

The work of Toronto-based artist and engineer Jonathan Heppner, AudioGL is a stunning vision of music creation in 3D space, with modular synths, advanced user-editable modulation, and a freely-navigable, open-ended spatial workspace.
