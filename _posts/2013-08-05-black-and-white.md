#Black And White Toys
##Taking some (amateurish) photos of toys
The “retro” multiple tones of gray and the bold shadows are some of the reasons why some people falling in love with black and white photos.

Possibly our brain decodes better the details of a black and white photography and supplements differently what is missing. 

But wait .. The colourless, temporal and mysterious magic emitted from black and white can’t be explained so simply..

Let your imagination take you back to my small photographic journey through the toys (?) of my mature age.
